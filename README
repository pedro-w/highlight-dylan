This repository contains highlight.js support for the Dylan language.

Dylan is a multi-paradigm functional and object-oriented programming
language. It is dynamic while providing a programming model designed
to support efficient machine code generation, including fine-grained
control over dynamic and static behaviors.

# Example

    var dylanGrammar = require('highlight-dylan')
    hljs.registerLanguage('dylan', dylanGrammar)
